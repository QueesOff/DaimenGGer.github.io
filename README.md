# Portfolio landing

The project is a small landing page created for the demonstration and presentation of the portfolio.
It is designed to effectively represent the works, projects and achievements of the author or company.
The main page of the site contains brief information about professional skills and areas of activity. 
The main emphasis is on the visual representation of works using photos, videos or screenshots of projects. 
Each work or project is represented by a separate section or page with a description of the tasks, 
the work performed and the technologies used. There may also be sections on the site with customer information, 
reviews and contact details for communication. The design of the landing site strives to be attractive, 
modern and intuitive for visitors in order to effectively present a portfolio and interest potential customers or employers.
